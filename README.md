Just got out of seeing Snow White again. The new one. Still kind of reeling, in that I-just-sat-through-a-cinematic-rainbow way. My feet are sore from all the popcorn retrieval runs (seriously, who manages to drop more popcorn than what ends up in their mouth?). Anyway, back to Snow White... God, where do I even start?

The magic mirror thing was all shiny and impressive, but, come on, I felt like it was more of a magic TV screen. Fits of laughter here and there, but also some real cringe moments. Those dwarfs, or are they called differently now? I've lost track, but they didn't seem too thrilled about their height restrictions. I mean, let them be tall, they'll work it out!

> And the queen. Oh boy, the queen. Way too obsessed with her reflection. Aren't we all, though? But chill out lady, it's just a phase. I swear on my espresso machine, she must go through more apples a day than a fruitarian on a juice cleanse. I can't even look at a Granny Smith the same.

It’s hilarious to think that a single kiss can fix everything. If life was that simple, Starbucks' bad coffee days could be kissed back to life. I think I was more excited by the forest animals coordinating rescue missions. Makes me wonder if cats and raccoons have secret night meetings discussing human foolishness.

For some reason, I was half-expecting Snow White to whip out a smartphone and Google her way out of situations. Is it just me who finds the whole deer-in-the-headlights act outdated? She's supposed to be savvy, right? Maybe next remake she'll be a coder... Speaking of which:

```javascript
function magicMirror() {
  return Who's the fairest?;
}
```

I threw it in there because why not? 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or something if inclined, but it's got that kind of '𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it while folding laundry' vibe, unless you're into the nostalgia of it all, which I only half admit to.

And now, I'm off to dream deliriously of high-tech mirrors and apple plots. Maybe tomorrow I'll look in my own mirror and see an organized, well-rested goddess with intentional caffeine consumption. A barista's fantasy land, right?
